    "history": "Founded in New Orleans in 1974, the team moved to Salt Lake City in 1979 but kept the 'Jazz' name despite Utah having no jazz history. The franchise became a Western Conference powerhouse in the 1990s behind the pick-and-roll duo of John Stockton and Karl Malone, reaching two NBA Finals. They consistently field competitive teams and enjoy one of the loudest home-court advantages in the league due to the arena's acoustics. The Jazz are known for stability, having had only two head coaches (Jerry Sloan and Quin Snyder) span a 33-year period.",
