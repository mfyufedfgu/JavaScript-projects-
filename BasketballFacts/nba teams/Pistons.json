    "history": "Founded in 1941 as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, the franchise moved to Detroit in 1957 to capitalize on the 'Motor City' market. The team earned three NBA championships (1989, 1990, 2004) by building a legendary 'Bad Boys' reputation centered on physical defense and teamwork. This blue-collar identity remains the core of the franchise's culture, reflected in their move back to downtown Detroit in 2017. Their history is a testament to the city’s resilient spirit, moving through various arenas like the Pontiac Silverdome and The Palace.",
