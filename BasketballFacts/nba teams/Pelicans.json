    "history": "The franchise was originally the Charlotte Hornets, relocating to New Orleans in 2002 before rebranding as the Pelicans in 2013 to better reflect local Louisiana culture. During the mid-2000s, the team played several home games in Oklahoma City following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The transition to the Pelicans brought a new color scheme of navy, gold, and red, inspired by the state flag and the festive spirit of the city. Today, the team is focused on building a sustainable contender around versatile young stars in the heart of the Gulf South.",
