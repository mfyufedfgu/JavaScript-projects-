    "history": "The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks before moving to Milwaukee in 1951 and then St. Louis in 1955. They achieved their greatest success in St. Louis, winning the 1958 NBA Championship led by Hall of Famer Bob Pettit. The team eventually relocated to Atlanta in 1968, where they became a perennial playoff fixture during the high-flying Dominique Wilkins era of the 1980s. Today, the team is defined by its 'True to Atlanta' culture and a tradition of high-energy guard play in the heart of Georgia.",
