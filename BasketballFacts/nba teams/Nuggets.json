    "history": "Originally founded as the Denver Larks in 1967 as part of the ABA, the team rebranded as the Nuggets before joining the NBA in 1976. The franchise has never relocated, leveraging Denver's high altitude as a unique home-court advantage for decades. After years of high-scoring traditions like 'Run and Gun' basketball, they finally captured their first NBA title in 2023 led by Nikola Jokić. The Nuggets are defined by their Mile High culture and a history of legendary scorers ranging from Alex English to Carmelo Anthony.",
