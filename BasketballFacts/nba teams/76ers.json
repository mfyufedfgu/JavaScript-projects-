    "history": "Originally founded as the Syracuse Nationals in 1946, the franchise relocated to Philadelphia in 1963 and was renamed the 76ers to honor the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The team has a rich history of legendary players, including Wilt Chamberlain and Julius Erving, who led them to titles in 1967 and 1983. Known for the 'Trust the Process' era of the 2010s, the team has a tradition of resilient and often controversial rebuilding strategies. The 76ers remain a deeply ingrained part of Philadelphia's tough, sports-centric identity, playing in one of the league's most intense markets.",
