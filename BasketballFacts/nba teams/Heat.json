    "history": "Founded as an expansion team in 1988, the Miami Heat have never relocated and have built one of the NBA's most respected cultures. Under the guidance of Pat Riley, they won three championships (2006, 2012, 2013) during eras defined by superstars like Dwyane Wade and LeBron James. The 'Heat Culture' tradition focuses on unmatched conditioning, defensive intensity, and a 'next man up' philosophy. As the most successful post-merger expansion team, they remain a perennial championship threat and a central fixture of South Florida sports culture.",
