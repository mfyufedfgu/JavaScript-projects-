    "history": "Established as an expansion team in 1968, the Suns have been a mainstay in Phoenix for over 50 years and are one of the most successful franchises to never win a title. They became famous for high-octane offensive systems like the 'Seven Seconds or Less' era of the 2000s, led by Steve Nash. The team’s traditions include a vibrant sunburst aesthetic and one of the league’s most recognizable mascots, 'The Gorilla.' Today, under new ownership, the Suns have moved into an era of aggressive superstar recruitment, continuing their quest for an elusive first championship.",
