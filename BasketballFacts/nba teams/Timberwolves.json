    "history": "Founded in 1989, the Timberwolves returned the NBA to Minnesota nearly three decades after the original Lakers franchise relocated. The team spent much of its history under the leadership of Kevin Garnett, who led them to eight straight playoff appearances and a Western Conference Finals run in 2004. Despite long periods of rebuilding, the franchise has maintained a loyal following at the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis. Today, the 'Wolves' are entering a new era of competitiveness, leaning into a tradition of fierce defensive play and a talented young core.",
