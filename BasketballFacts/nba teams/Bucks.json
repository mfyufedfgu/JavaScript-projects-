The franchise has remained in Milwaukee, moving to the state-of-the-art Fiserv Forum in 2018 to revitalize the city's downtown. After a 50-year wait, they captured a second championship in 2021 behind the historic performance of Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Bucks are defined by a 'Fear the Deer' mentality and a tradition of elite big men that spans from the franchise's inception to the present day.",
