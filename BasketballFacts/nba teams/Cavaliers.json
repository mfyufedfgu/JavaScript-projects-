    "history": "Established as an expansion team in 1970, the Cavaliers have spent their entire existence in the Cleveland area, moving from the suburban Richfield Coliseum to downtown in 1994. The franchise reached its pinnacle in 2016 when Akron-native LeBron James led the team to its first NBA title, ending the city's 52-year championship drought. Traditions like 'The Land' branding and the 'Cavalier Girls' have helped build a tight-knit connection with their Northeast Ohio fanbase. The post-championship era has focused on a resilient youth movement and maintaining a competitive presence in the Central Division.",
