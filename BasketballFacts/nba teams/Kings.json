They won their only championship in 1951 as the Rochester Royals before decades of moving across the Midwest and West Coast. The team saw a major resurgence in the early 2000s and has recently been revitalized by the 'Light the Beam' tradition at the Golden 1 Center. As Sacramento's only major professional sports team, the Kings possess one of the league's most loyal and vocal home-court fanbases.",
