They established a standard of excellence by winning 11 titles in 13 years during the 1950s and 60s under the leadership of Bill Russell. The 'Celtics Pride' tradition continued through the Larry Bird era of the 1980s and culminated in a record-breaking 18th title in 2024. Known for their iconic parquet floor and 'Lucky the Leprechaun' mascot, the team represents the pinnacle of basketball history in New England.",
