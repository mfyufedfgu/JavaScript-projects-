    "history": "The franchise started in Chicago in 1961, then moved to Baltimore, before settling in the D.C. area as the Bullets. They won their only championship in 1978 led by Wes Unseld and Elvin Hayes in a gritty seven-game series. In 1997, owner Abe Pollin changed the name to 'Wizards' due to the violent undertones of 'Bullets.' The team famously hosted Michael Jordan's final comeback from 2001 to 2003. They remain a central part of D.C. sports, playing in the heart of Chinatown.",
