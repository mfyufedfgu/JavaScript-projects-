    "history": "Founded as an expansion team in 1980, the Mavericks have called Dallas home for their entire history, moving to the American Airlines Center in 2001. The franchise underwent a transformation under the ownership of Mark Cuban, leading to a decade of dominance and a 2011 NBA Championship led by Dirk Nowitzki. The team has a tradition of embracing international stars, a legacy that began with Nowitzki and continues today with Luka Dončić. Known for their 'MFFL' (Mavs Fan For Life) community, the team remains a cornerstone of the North Texas sports landscape.",

      "The team name 'Mavericks' was chosen by fans over options like 'Wranglers' and 'Express'.",
      "They are one of the few teams to have retired a number for a player who never played for them (Brad Davis #15... wait, Brad Davis did play for them. Kobe Bryant #24 is the correct non-player retired number).",
      "Luka Dončić recorded a 60-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist triple-double in 2022, a feat never before seen in NBA history."
