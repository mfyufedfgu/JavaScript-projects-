    "history": "Founded in 1970, the Trail Blazers captured an NBA title in just their seventh season (1977) during the 'Blazermania' phenomenon led by Bill Walton. The team has never relocated and once held an incredible 814-game sellout streak at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Known as 'Rip City,' the franchise is famous for its dedicated fanbase and a history of legendary guard play, most notably from Clyde Drexler and Damian Lillard. The Blazers are a vital part of Portland's cultural fabric, emphasizing a unique connection between the city and its only major professional basketball team.",
