They returned to a new San Francisco home at Chase Center in 2019 after establishing a modern dynasty with four titles in eight years. The franchise is defined by its revolutionary three-point shooting era led by the 'Splash Brothers' and a tradition of innovative offensive play. As the only team to use a state nickname rather than a city name, they represent the entire Bay Area basketball community.",
